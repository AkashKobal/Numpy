## 6. Copies and views 
# Slicing operation creates a view on the original array which is just a way of 
# accessing the data. Thus, the original array is not copied in the memory. 
# You can use <strong>np.may_share_memory()</strong> to check whether two arrays share the same memory block.

a = np.arange(10)
b = a[::2]
print(np.shares_memory(a,b))

b[0] = 10
print(b)
print(a) #a is also updated, since is shares the same location in memory

c = a[::2].copy() #force the copy
print(np.shares_memory(a,c))

c[0] = 5
print(c)
print(a)
